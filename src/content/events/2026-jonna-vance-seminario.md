### Session 1: High-Level Properties and the Hallmarks of Perception

We'll discuss an emerging methodology for how to determine whether a given property is represented in perception--including high-level properties such as relations, animacy, and value. The methodology is called the "hallmarks approach." These hallmarks of perception include: processing speed; extraction from brief exposure; automaticity; spatiotopic repulsive adaptation; binocular rivalry advantages; and feature binding. We could compare this methodology to an older one from Susanna Siegel called "phenomenal contrast". We could ask whether this methodology is too conservative (including too few processes as perceptual) or too liberal (including too many). We could read some of my recent unpublished papers on this topic (one of which has been accepted at Mind). We could also look at recent work on this topic by Brian Scholl, Chaz Firestone, Ned Block, and others.

### Session 2: Cognitive Penetration and Predictive Processing

We'd discuss whether predictive processing provides good reason to accept the existence of cognitive penetration.
