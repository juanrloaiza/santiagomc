We are Santiago Mind and Cognition, a research group focused on **philosophy
of mind and cognitive science**. The group started in 2018 in Santiago
(Chile), based at Universidad Alberto Hurtado. Our research includes topics
such as perception, action, emotion, AI, consciousness, and other related
areas in mind and brain research. Our main goal is to build a broader
network with other universities, research centers and societies, for the
promotion, exchange and diffusion of research in philosophy of mind and
related areas.
